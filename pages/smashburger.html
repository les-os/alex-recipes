        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 soft hamburger bun</li>
            <li>4 oz freshly ground beef chuck, divided in half</li>
            <li>kosher salt</li>
            <li>black pepper</li>
            <li>1 slice cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>optional condiments and toppings as desired, such as mayonnaise, mustard, shredded lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles </li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun. Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.</li>

            <li>Preheat a large stainless steel saut√© pan or skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in pan and smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly wider than burger bun.</li>

            <li>Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until patties are well browned and tops are beginning to turn pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. Using a bench scraper or the back side of a stiff metal spatula, carefully scrape patties from pan, making sure to get all of the browned bits.</li>
            
            <li>Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 1 patty, then stack the second directly on top. Immediately remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
